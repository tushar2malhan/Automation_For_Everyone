we make sure we try to open the website webpage, by checking with keyword careers, jobs,  or anything related to positions 
- secondly we also need to check for extension after clicking the webpage 
like current url dosen't work which is https://www.tejasnetworks.com/careers 
but this url works which is https://www.tejasnetworks.com/careerscareers.php
so we make sure we try to place each extension on each  keyword related to keyword careers, jobs,  or anything related to positions 


        driver.get(driver.current_url+'careers')
        
        if "404" in driver.page_source or "Page not found" in driver.page_source:
            print("404 Error or Page not found message is displayed.")
            continue
